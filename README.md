# Computational Mathematics Lab Lectures

Lectures in Computational Mathematics using Sage Computer Algebra System.

The aim of the course is to develop computational algebraic methods to find exact solutions to nonlinear systems of equations. The principal topics include:
<ul> 
  <li> Introduction to Python and Sage.</li>
  <li> Factorization and irreducibility test algorithms.</li>
  <li> Symbolic integration of rational functions.</li>
  <li> Multivariate polynomial reduction and Gr√∂bner bases.</li>
</ul>
