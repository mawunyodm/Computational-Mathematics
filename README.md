# Computational Mathematics Lab Lectures

Lectures in Computational Mathematics using Sage Computer Algebra System.

The aim of the course is to develop computational algebraic methods to find exact solutions to nonlinear systems of equations. The principal topics include:
<ul> 
  <li>Introduction to Sage and math-oriented programming</li>
  <li>Fundamental algorithms</li>
  <li>Fast Fourier transform and fast multiplication</li>
  <li>Square-free decomposition of polynomials</li>
  <li>Real root counting and root separation</li>
  <li>Root approximation</li>
  <li>Groebner bases and elimination theory</li>
</ul>
